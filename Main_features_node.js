Q) What are 7 main features of node.js ?

• Single threaded
• Asynchronous
• Event-driven
• V8 Javascript engine
• Cross-Platform
• NPM
• Real-Time Capabilites


Q) What is Single Threaded Programming?
  A single-threaded language is one that can execute only one task at a time. The program will execute the tasks in sequence, and each task must complete before the next task starts.

Q) What is Synchronous Programming?

  •Event-driven architecture - handling events will be very easy
  •cross-platofrm - supports deployment on various operating systems, enhancing flexibility
  •javascript

Q) What are disadvantages of nodejs?
   Avoid in CPU intensive tasks, multi threaded will be btter compared to
